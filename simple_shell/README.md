/**
 *SIMPLE SHELL PROJECT
 *====================
 *
 *
 * A simple shell like program project built in c programming language
 *
 * This project was done by Onuoha Harrison and Ugwuoke Chisom during
 *
 *the ALX Software Engineering Program 
 *
 *
 *
 * It is not as robust as the standard shell, but as basic functionalities such as:
 *
 *
 * read input from standard input stream until EOF(end of file) or "exit" keyword is encountered
 *
 *
 * execute program by checking if exist in current working directory first, if not is searches for the path of the program, then execute it if found, else it throws an error prompt  
 *
 *
 * As at the point of uploading this program, this simple shell programonly executes built_in shell commands
 *
 *
